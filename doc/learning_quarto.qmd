# Intro

**Momma**, just *killed* a man

# Methods and results

Put a **gun** against his head, pulled my *trigger*

## Analysis

Now *he's* **dead**
```{r}
2*2
```


# Discussion

**Momma**, life had *just* begun, but now I've ^gone^ and thrown it all ~away~

```{r setup}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
library(NHANES)
nhanes_small <- read_csv(here::here("data/nhanes_small.csv"))
```

## Table of results

```{r mean-age-bmi-table}
nhanes_small %>%
  filter(!is.na(diabetes), !is.na(education)) %>%
  group_by(diabetes, education) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_bmi = mean(bmi, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Mean values of Age and BMI for each education and diabetes status.")
```

## Prettier table

```{r prettier-table}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
nhanes_small %>%
  filter(!is.na(diabetes), !is.na(education)) %>%
  group_by(diabetes, education) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_bmi = mean(bmi, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    # Task 2a.
    mean_age = round(mean_age, 1),
    mean_bmi = round(mean_bmi, 1),
    # Task 2b.
    education = str_to_sentence(education)
  ) %>%
  rename(
    # Task 3.
    "Diabetes Status" = diabetes,
    "Education" = education,
    "Mean Age" = mean_age,
    "Mean BMI" = mean_bmi
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Mean values of Age and BMI for each education and diabetes status.")
```
